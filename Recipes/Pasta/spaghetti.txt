Cook the pasta until al dente and set it aside. In a skillet, sautÃ© minced garlic in olive oil until fragrant. Add diced tomatoes, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper to the skillet and simmer for about 10 minutes. Toss the cooked spaghetti in the tomato sauce and heat it through. Serve the spaghetti in bowls, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese.

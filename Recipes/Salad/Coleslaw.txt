In a large bowl, combine shredded cabbage, grated carrots, and thinly sliced onions.
In a separate small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, salt, and black pepper to make the dressing.
Pour the dressing over the cabbage mixture and toss until well coated. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to blend together. Enjoy!
